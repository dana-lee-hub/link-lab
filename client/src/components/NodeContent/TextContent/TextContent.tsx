   * of this lab we randomly generate them in the `textAnchors.ts` file in the

   * creates 3 anchors - this is just for the sake of the lab and the fact
   * we do not yet have a functional front end!

   * We want to loop through our list of existing anchors and have access to the current useRef
   * object that our text is contained within. This is tricky, so feel free to ask a TA for
   * guidance on this!
   *
   * Some useful things to know - in this case `Element` is the text that our useRef refers to:
   * - Element.current.innerHTML will give you the innerHTML of your text.
   *   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML
   *
   * - Element.textRef.current.innerText will give you the innerText of your text
   *   the startCharacter and end Character should be relative to this.
